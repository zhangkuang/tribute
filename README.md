## A Collection
Collections are configuration objects for Tribute, you can have multiple for each instance. This is useful for scenarios where you may want to match multiple trigger keys, such as `@` for users and `#` for projects.


Collection object shown with defaults:
```js
{
  //ture:自动定位，false：手动定位，other：at列表宽度
  positionMenu: true||false||"tribute-container's width",

}
```
